            <h2>Shubman Gill was born on September 8, 1999, in Chak Jaimal Singh Wala, a village in the Fazilka district of Punjab, India. Hailing from a farming family, his father, Lakhwinder Singh, had aspirations of becoming a cricketer but had to abandon them due to financial constraints. Recognizing his son's talent, Lakhwinder decided to train Shubman himself, bowling 500 to 700 balls daily. In 2007, to provide better training opportunities, the family moved to Mohali, near the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium.</h2>

            <h2>Shubman attended school in Mohali, where he balanced his academic pursuits with his passion for cricket. At the age of 12, his performance caught the attention of former Indian bowler Karsan Ghavri, who recommended that Shubman attend the Under-19 all-India pace bowlers' camp. Facing U-19 bowlers in the nets, Ghavri requested the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) to include him in Punjab's U-14 team. He formed a strong partnership with Abhishek Sharma, with whom he opened the innings for Punjab in the under-14s.</h2>

In an Inter-District Under-16 match against Amritsar, representing Mohali, he scored 351 runs and shared a record opening stand of 587 runs with Nirmal Singh. This remarkable feat showcased his prodigious talent and set the stage for his future successes.</h2>
